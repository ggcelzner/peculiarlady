    <h1> The Daily Front Row </h1>

            OBJECTIVE: Work with Art Director to create pages daily.

        DESCRIPTION: During my time at The Daily Front Row I started out as an intern and then became a freelancer. The overall goal was to create a magazine each day during New York Fashion Week so that it can be pubilshed and passed out to atendees of the shows, fast paced work indeed. I worked with the Art Director to produce the pages I was assigned along with newspaper ads and some marketing material. I also had the opportunity to work with other magazines that were part of IMG during the off season Like Cesars Way Dog Magazine and the Twilight Saga magazine.
